# AndroidID-31435731

This issue has been released in the [December](https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2016-12-01.html) 2016 Android Security Bulletin.

I found it occasionlly Nov 2015. The root problem is very simple and clear, but it can lead privilege escalation easily.

It seems that this issue is not the first time to be discussed. So there is just an old CVE number(CVE-2015-8966) assigned to it, not a new one. 

The details can be found here:
